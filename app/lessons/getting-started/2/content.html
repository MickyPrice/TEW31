<h1>What's a variable?</h1>
<hr>
<p>
  A great way to describe variables is, imagine the variable as a box that you store stuff in.<br>
  You can call on these variables later on, for example, you could use a variable to store someones name.<br>
  In JavaScript, this would be written as <code>var name = "Michael";</code>, this variable is called <b>name</b> and it's value is "Michael".<br>

      }
    })
