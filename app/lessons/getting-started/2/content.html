<h1>What's a variable?</h1>
<hr>
<p>
  A great way to describe variables is, imagine the variable as a box that you store stuff in.<br>
  You can call on these variables later on, for example, you could use a variable to store someones name.<br>
  In JavaScript, this would be written as <code>var name = "Michael";</code>, this variable is called <b>name</b> and it's value is "Michael".<br>

<h1>What different types of variables exist?</h1>
<hr>
<p>
  The great part about variables is that they can store almost anything, the different types of variables are:
  <ul>
    <li>Strings (Words, wrapped in quotations eg, "This is a string")</li>
    <li>Integers (Numbers)</li>
    <li>Boolean (true or false)</li>
    <li>Array (lists)</li>
    <li>Objects (lists with keys)</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h1>What does each variable do and how do I write it?</h1>
<hr>
<p>
  I'll start out with the easier ones, <b>strings</b>, <b>integers</b> and <b>booleans</b>.<br>
</p>
<h2>Strings</h2>
<p>
  A <b>string</b> is just words, strings can be stuff like a person's name, a car, a country name etc.<br>
  Strings are written with quotation marks around the text, for example, if I was trying to make a variable named country with the value of New Zealand, I would write
  <code>var country = "New Zealand"</code>
</p>
<h2>Integers</h2>
<p>
  <b>Integers</b> are numbers, for example, it could be someone's age, a year, a price etc<br>
  Integers can't have anything else but a number, for example, if you write "$100", it will be a string, not an integer.<br>
  Integers don't have quotes around them when written. If I were to make a variable called myAge and it held my age, I would write
  <code>var myAge = 16</code>
</p>
<h2>Boolean</h2>
<p>
  <b>Booleans</b> are true or false statments, they can't be shortned to "t" or "f", they must always be true or false. You also can't wrap them in quotes or they become strings<br>
  An example of a boolean could be if someone is right handed or not, if they are, it would be true, if not, it would be false.<br>
  If I wanted to write that as a variable, I would call it isRightHanded and I'll set it true.
  <code>var isRightHanded = true</code>
</p>


<h1>Lets talk about the harder variable types. (Arrays and Objects)</h1>
<h2>Arrays</h2>
<p>
  <b>Arrays</b> are just <b>lists</b>.<br>
  They can store multiple different variable types (Integer, Boolean, String, Objects and even arrays! That's right! You can have arrays inside arrays!).<br>
  So, a list is written inside square [brackets], their values are a comma seperated list, so for example, a list that contains some dinosaur names would be written like
  <code>var dinosaurs = []</code>
</p>


<h2>Objects</h2>
<p>
  <b>Objects</b> are slightly harder. They are lists but they have keys for each values.<br>
  Objects can be used to store a whole bunch of information about a single subject, an example could be an object about a person. Below I'll show you how that would be written.
  <code>
  var michael = {
    firstName: "Michael",
    lastName: "Price",
    school: "Rangiora High School",
    age: 16,
    hair: "brown",
    wearsGlasses: false
  }
  </code>
  We probably wont use these very often during this course but it is important to know about and by all means, feel free to lean more about any of these variables elsewhere!
