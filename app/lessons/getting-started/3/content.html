<h1>What is a statment?</h1>
<hr>
<p>
  Statments are basically questions (I know, that doesn't really make sense but that's how it is.)<br>
  We'll talk about 4 statments, "IF", "IFElse", "While" and "For", all of these are basically questions.

<h2>IF statments</h2>
<p>
  IF statments basically trigger only IF a value is met, for example:
  <code>
    var age = 15;
    if(age =&lt 16){
      // This would not run because
    }
  </code>
</p>
