<h1>It's just like math!</h1>
<p>
  Math in JS is just like real math believe it or not!
  <br>
  The hardest part is knowing the sytnax (And that's easy!).<br>
  I'm going to assume you know basic math since you're taking a course about JavaScript.<br>

</p>
<h2>Syntax</h2>
<p>
  In math, the times is written as <b>*</b> instead of <b>x</b><br><br>
  Divide is written as <b>/</b> instead of <b>รท</b><br><br>
  Addition is still written as <b>+</b><br><br>
  And minus is still written as <b>-</b><br><br>
</p>

<h2>Lets put it into code</h2>
<br>
<p>
  <code>
  10 * 5;
  // Outputs 50

  10 / 5;
  // Outputs 2

  10 + 5;
  // Outputs 15

  10 - 5;
  // Outputs 5
  </code>
</p>

<h2>BEDMAS</h2>
<p>
  (Brackets, Exponents, Divide, Multiply, Addition then Subtraction)<br>
  BEDMAS is the order that mathmatical opperations are performed. Math inside brackets gets done first, then the exponents, then the division and so on.<br><br>
  In JS, BEDMAS still applies so you'll still use round brackets.<br>
  For example, <b>5 + 5 * 2</b> will output <b>15</b> <br>
  but <b>(5 + 5) * 2</b> will output <b>20</b>
</p>
<h3>Power</h3>
<p>
  The last one which is a little strange is to the power of.<br>
  This uses a function that takes 2 paramaters. The first is the number, the second is the power of.<br>
  The function is math.pow(NUM, POWEROF). For example, say I want to find 5 to the power of 2, I would write
  <code>
  math.pow(5, 2);
  // This outputs 25
  </code>
</p>
