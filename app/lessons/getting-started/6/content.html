<h1>What is the DOM?</h1>
<p>
  DOM stands for Document Object Model.<br>
  The DOM is the page the user sees, it's the HTML code.<br>
  When you view a site, you're looking at the document. Everything inside the document is a bunch of objects.<br>

<h1>Why would I want to edit the DOM?</h1>
<p>
  Editing the DOM is one of the most common uses for JavaScript,
  it lets you make cool animations, show important data,
  drag and drop stuff, dropdowns and much more!<br>
  To get an element, you have a few options.
</p>

<h2>How do I edit DOM?</h2>
<p>
  The document is stored as one large object simply named "document".<br>
  If you do <code>console.log(document)</code> you can see the entire DOM.<br><br>

  You probably don't want the entire DOM, there's a few common functions used involving the DOM.<br>
  The first is <b>Getting IDs</b>. Say you have a HTML element with the id "username" and you want to set the innerText of it to my name (Michael Price).

  <br>
  To do this, you'd type
  <code>
  document.getElementById('username').innerText = "Michael Price";
  </code>
</p>

<p>
  Another option is to get an list of elements with a <b>certain class</b>.
  Say you have 3 elements with the class "blue" and you want to set the background color of these to blue.<br>
  To do this, you'd use the <code>document.getElementsByClassName()</code> function.<br>
  Since it's an object, you can't directly set values to it, you'd need to use a for loop because it's essentially an array.

  <br>
  To do this, you'd type
  <code>
    for (var i = 0; i < document.getElementByClassName('blue').length; i++) {
      document.getElementByClassName('blue')[i].style.backgroundColor = "blue";
    }
  </code>
  The code above basically sets a variable (i) to 0, it then repeats every time the length of the class array (document.getElementByClassName('blue')) is more than (i).<br>
  Every time it loops, it adds 1 to (i) until (i) is equal to the number of classes.<br>
  For each class, it will get the style.backgroundColor to "blue".
