<h1>How do you actually trigger these functions?</h1>
<p>
  So, by now, you've learnt about functions, variables and much more but it's pretty useless if your users can't easily use them.<br>
  The way you trigger functions with clicks, user inputs, hover and more is using <b>events</b>

<h2>How do we actually attach a listener?</h2>
<p>
  Below is an example of how we can trigger a click event to run a function.<br>
  It shows a input field with a button next to it, that button has a click event listener attached to it that will trigger a function called "addNewItem()".
  This function will be called every single time the user clicks the button.<br>
</p>
<img class="mt-8" src="/assets/img/lessonImages/GS7/events2.png" draggable="false" alt="">
<p>
  In this example, the addNewItem function would probably take what the user has put into the input and add it to the todo list.
